# Changelog

All notable changes to Tvastar are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project aims to follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-04

### Added

- **`tvastar-fix`** — a flagship application built on Tvastar: a CLI and a
  GitHub Action that auto-fix a failing test suite. An agent edits the source
  and iterates; Tvastar re-runs the suite itself and reports success from the
  real exit code (never the model's claim). Free-model friendly (auto-selects
  Groq / OpenAI / Anthropic / local Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint).
  Includes a composite GitHub Action (`action/action.yml`) and an example
  PR-opening workflow.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-04

Initial release. Tvastar is a programmable agent harness for Python:
`Agent = Model + Harness`.

### Added

- **Core harness** — the model↔tool agent loop, `Session`, `Harness`, and
  `create_agent` / `AgentSpec`.
- **Model layer** — a provider-agnostic `Model` interface with adapters for
  Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI (and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint via `base_url`:
  Cloudflare Workers AI, Groq, Together, Ollama, vLLM, …), and a scripted
  `MockModel` for offline/testing.
- **Tools** — the `@tool` decorator with automatic JSON-Schema generation from
  type hints, a registry, and a built-in toolset (bash, read/write/edit, list,
  glob, grep).
- **Sandboxes** — pluggable execution: `VirtualSandbox` (in-memory, runs real
  Python with no Docker), `LocalSandbox` (jailed subprocess), and external
  adapters (`DockerSandbox`, generic `RemoteSandbox` for E2B/Daytona/Modal),
  governed by a `SecurityPolicy`.
- **Skills** — Markdown-with-frontmatter expertise packages, loaded on demand.
- **Memory & durable execution** — in-memory and JSON-on-disk stores; full
  transcript + filesystem checkpointing with crash-safe resume.
- **MCP** — a Model Context Protocol client over stdio (local servers) and
  streamable HTTP/SSE (remote servers); MCP tools mount as native tools.
- **Failure detection** — in-process detectors for silent failures
  (`unknown_tool`, `schema_mismatch`, `thrash_loop`, `ignored_tool_error`,
  `unverified_completion`, `empty_answer`, `step_limit`), attached to
  `RunResult.findings`.
- **Observability** — span tracing with console, JSONL, and OpenTelemetry
  exporters.
- **Serving & deploy** — a CLI (`tvastar chat/serve/run/info`), a FastAPI
  HTTP+WebSocket server, and deploy adapters for ASGI hosts, AWS Lambda,
  GitHub Actions / GitLab CI, and generic FaaS.
- Examples, a test suite, CI (lint + format + tests on Python 3.10–3.13), and a
  live real-model proof run.
